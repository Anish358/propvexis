/* Button — PropVexis primitive.
 *
 * THIS WRAPPER EXISTS TO KEEP THE APP'S EXISTING PROP VOCABULARY. The app has had
 * a primitive layer since Phase 1 (`ui.jsx` over the `.u-*` classes) and eight
 * pages are written against its API: variant="primary|secondary|ghost|danger",
 * size="sm|md|lg", block, as. shadcn's Button speaks a different dialect —
 * variant="default|outline|…", size="xs|sm|default|lg|icon…", and Base UI's
 * `render` in place of `as`.
 *
 * Translating here rather than at every call site is the entire point of this
 * layer: a page migrates by changing ONE import line and no JSX moves. It also
 * lets the two layers coexist during the migration — a page still on ui.jsx and a
 * page on primitives read identically in source.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGES VISUALLY: geometry and states now come from the approved preset
 * (radius, height, type size, hover behaviour) instead of from `.u-btn` in legacy
 * CSS. Colours were already shared — both resolve the same tokens through the
 * bridge. That difference is the point of the migration, not a regression.

// Our vocabulary -> the library's. `secondary` maps to `outline`, not to shadcn's
// `secondary`, because `.u-btn--secondary` is a bordered surface (--surface-2 +
// --line) which is what `outline` draws; shadcn's `secondary` is a filled tint
// with no border.
